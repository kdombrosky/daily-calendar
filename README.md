# Daily Work Planner

## Purpose
A website to allow users to plan out their work day by the hour. 
As the day progresses, tasks are updated to show if they have passed, coming soon, or currently happening. 

All tasks are saved to local storage upon save button click, and the page updates itself every 30 minutes.
